#### Guidelines for the test
- You have 30 minutes to complete the test.
- Create a single page site and name the web page as `index.html`
- Name the project folder as `your_name_web_interview` in **snake_case**. Eg `kevin_kimaru_web_interview`.
- More marks will be awarded for creativity and captivating designs rather than content and size of the website. So, whatever little you do, do it to your best.
- You should be able to explain every bit of code you use.
- You are free to use any framework or library you dim best. Focus on getting the work done.

**All the best!!**
